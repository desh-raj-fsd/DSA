//Frequency Counters

/**
 * The Frequency Counter Pattern is a powerful approach in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) for solving problems that involve:
 *
 * Comparing frequencies of elements.
 * Counting occurrences of characters, numbers, or other entities.
 * Identifying unique or duplicate elements.
 *
 * Here are common scenarios where the Frequency Counter Pattern is useful, along with examples:
 * Anagram Problems
 * Finding Duplicate Elements
 * Character Frequency Comparison
 * Finding the Most Frequent Element
 * Subarray or Substring Problems
 * Count Pair Problems
 *
 * This pattern used objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of values..
 * This can often avoid the need for nested loops or O(N^2) oprations with array/strings.
