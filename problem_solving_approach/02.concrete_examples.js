// Problem =>
// Write a function which takes in a string and return counts of each character in the string?

// Step One
// Understand The Problem
// 1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
("return counts of each character of input string");
// 2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
("String");
("Can this string also contain numering character?");
("What about spaces? do we have to count spaces?");
("What about capital latters do we have to return them sepratly?");
("What about those latters which are not in the string");
// 3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
("What are the output of empty inputs");
("What are the outputs of invalid imputs");
// 4. Can the output be determined from the inputs? Or do I have enough information to solve the problem?
// 5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are part of the problem?
