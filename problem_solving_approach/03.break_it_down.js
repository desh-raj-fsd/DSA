// Break it Down.

// Explicitly write out the steps you need to Take.
// note=> This forces you to think about the code you'll write before you write it, and helps you to catch any lingering conceptual isues or misunderstandings before you dive in and to worry about details like language syntex.

// Problem =>
// Write a function which takes in a string and return counts of each character in the string?

function charCount(str) {
  // do somthing
  // return an object with keys that are lowercase alphanumeric charcters in the string
}

function charCount(str) {
  // make object to return at end.
  // lowercase string.
  // loop over string. for each charcter...
  // if the char is a number/letter and is a key in object, add one to the count
  // if the char is a number/letter and not in the object, add it and set value to 1
  // if char is something else (space, period, etc.) don't do anything
  // return object at end.
}
