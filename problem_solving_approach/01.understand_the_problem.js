// Understand The Problem
// 1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
// 2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
// 3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
// 4. Can the output be determined from the inputs? Or do I have enough information to solve the problem?
// 5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are part of the problem?

// 1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
"Implement addition"

// 2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?

`Are we working with only two inputs?
How large will the inputs be?
Are we allowed to pass floats?`
// 3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?

`What should the output look like?
Do we need to get a float output?
Should the output be a string, number, or float?`
// 4. Can the output be determined from the inputs? Or do I have enough information to solve the problem?

`What if the user passes only one number? What should we return?`
// 5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are part of the problem?
