/**
 * Second Largest
 * Given an array of positive integers arr[], return the second largest element from the array.
 * If the second largest element doesn't exist then return -1.
 
 * Note: The second largest element should not be equal to the largest element.
 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: arr[] = [12, 35, 1, 10, 34, 1]
 * Output: 34
 * Explanation: The largest element of the array is 35 and the second largest element is 34.
 
 * Example 2:
 * Input: arr[] = [10, 5, 10]
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: The largest element of the array is 10 and the second largest element is 5.
 
 * Example 3:
 * Input: arr[] = [10, 10, 10]
 * Output: -1
 * Explanation: The largest element of the array is 10 and the second largest element does not exist.
